## Hi there 👋
lets go to the *Stage 1*.
> Once upon a time, there was a brave pirate named Captain Jack. Captain Jack always wore a big hat with a big feather and had a shiny sword. 
He had a best friend, Pirate Penny, who was very smart and always had good ideas. 
There was also a parrot named Polly, who loved to talk and a little monkey named Max, who was very playful.
